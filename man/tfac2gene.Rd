\title{Transcription factor to genes (tfac2gene)}
\usage{
tfac2gene(tfac, regulation_type = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{tfac}{Transcription factor label (string). Example: "NKX31_HUMAN".}

\item{regulation_type}{Type of regulation (string): "positive", "negative", or "all". Default: "all".}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing gene names, databases, articles, evidence levels, and definitions for the specified regulation type, sorted by gene name. If regulation_type is "all", a named list with data.frames for positive and negative regulation is returned. If no data is available, a message is returned.
}
\description{
Function to obtain genes regulated by a specific transcription factor, filtered by regulation type.
